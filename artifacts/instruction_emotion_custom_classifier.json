Ensure the classification is consistent with the gold labels provided.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input is a string containing a sentence.\n\n## Task Requirements\n\n1. Identify the sentiment of the sentence.\n2. Classify the sentiment into one of the following emotions: 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral', or 'frustration'.\n3. Provide a reasoning for the classification, which may include analysis of the sentence structure, punctuation, and emotional cues.\n4. Consider the presence of emotional cues such as emotional adverbs and adjectives.\n5. Be aware that emotions are not mutually exclusive, and a sentence can express multiple emotions simultaneously.\n6. Tone markers such as exclamation marks and question marks can influence the emotional tone of a sentence.\n\n## Niche and Domain-Specific Information\n\n1. Sentences with strong negative opinions may express frustration, sadness, or anger.\n2. Sentences with positive opinions may express happiness or joy.\n3. Neutral sentences may lack strong emotional connotations or express a calm and moderate tone.\n4. The presence of emotional cues such as emotional adverbs and adjectives can influence the emotional tone of a sentence.\n5. Exclamation marks and question marks can significantly impact the emotional tone of a sentence.\n6. The use of negative emotional words and phrases can indicate frustration or sadness.\n7. The use of positive emotional words and phrases can indicate happiness.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nUtilize a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including:\n1. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging to identify emotional cues such as emotional adverbs and adjectives.\n2. Named entity recognition (NER) to identify sentiment-bearing entities such as opinions and emotions.\n3. Sentiment analysis to classify the sentiment of the sentence.\n4. Contextual understanding to analyze the sentence structure and punctuation.\n5. Rule-based approaches to classify the sentiment into one of the four emotions.\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\nThe performance of the model will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n## Expected Output Format\nThe expected output is a dictionary with two keys: 'emotion' and 'reasoning'. The 'emotion' key maps to one of the four emotions: 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral', or 'frustration'. The 'reasoning' key maps to a string containing the analysis and justification for the classification.",
